# SAMRewritten Installer for Steam Deck

## What Is This?

This is a simple set of scripts meant to install a compiled version I had to scrape from GitHub pull requests of [PaulCombal\'s SAMRewritten Tool](https://github.com/PaulCombal/SamRewritten) for a Steam Deck. You can use this as you normally would [SAM](https://github.com/gibbed/SteamAchievementManager) on a Windows machine.
